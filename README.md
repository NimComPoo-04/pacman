# PACMAN

Very Old Game With a Small Twist,
It does not have any scoring system or of the sort
just plain fun.

The Levels start on their own, each level the ghosts exit
their home after a given number of seconds.

Arrow Keys for movement,
or Mouse movents can also be used control pacman.

Escape Key to Exit the game.

Pause by Using Space.
